 If any of the *.xls files is opened simply by double-clicking, it is possible that 
 Excel will automatically convert some gene symbols to dates. This file explains 
 how to avoid this.  

Normalized counts for ALL samples:
 counts_gene/
     Proj_*_htseq_all_samples.txt - RAW counts for each gene/sample generated by HTSeq.
     counts_scaled_DESeq.xls - normalized counts for each gene/sample. Counts were scaled 
                           using DESeq method, and genes with mean counts less than 
                           15 in both conditions were filtered out.  


Sample clustering:
 clustering/
     MDS_plot.pdf - plot showing multidimentional scaling of all samples (principal 
                component analysis of normalized counts)
     counts_DESeqscaled_clust.pdf - plot showing hierarchical clustering of all samples

Differential Expression (for each comparison):
 differentialExpression_gene/
     ALLResDESeq_A_vs_B.xls - fold changes (log2 scale), p-values, adjusted p-values for 
                          all genes
     ResDESeq_A_vs_B.xls - fold changes (log2 scale), adjusted p-values and mean counts 
                       for each condition, for ONLY genes meeting fold change cutoff 
                       log2(2) and adjusted p-value cutoff 0.05. These are the genes 
                       considered to be differentially expressed between condition A 
                       and condition B. 
                       **Note, genes with count 0 in one condition are also included 
                       even though p-values are not significant. This is because we 
                       feel that some of these transcripts may still be of interest 
                       and so we do not exclude them from the results.
